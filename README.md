This is a Kevin Nguyen Pokemon Database

Base stats for all pokemon  
Abilities(base/hidden)  
Perhaps some queries/metrics(how many ghost type pokemon are there)

Common Held Items  
EV Spread/Team Mates?  
If legendary/mythical/paradox/NFE/other classifications(starter, fossil, psuedo-leg?, )  
What generation?  
Weaknesses/Resistances/Type Matchups(can make logic thing for this, like +-1 for weakness/resist -999 for immune)
    does not take into account for abilities that make immune

To Do List  
make website for this  
See how to match up pokemon from different sites  
Scrape Pikalytics each format->Put in DB for the ones you find, but don't replace(some aren't in national dex for gen 9)   
    which also gets u the most recent data  
See how to update it instead of dropping and redoing it each time lol
names might be a little weird
primary keys for number/name
get pictures for each pokemon
filter for stats(needs a little work)(sorting by number makes it wacky)
search function for a pokemon, by name or number
